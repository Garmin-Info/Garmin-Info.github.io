# Placing or moving points

:exclamation: When creating or modifying a route, make sure to place all points **on** the road. (See [Imported routes and tracks](Imported routes and tracks) for more on this)

:exclamation: Make sure that **Via points** are placed **after** a turn, otherwise the turn notification may come too early to react to it.
